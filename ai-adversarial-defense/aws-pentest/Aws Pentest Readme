# AWS Pentesting Script

## Overview
This project scans AWS S3 buckets to identify security misconfigurations, such as publicly accessible storage. It helps detect vulnerabilities in AWS environments.

## Installation & Setup
1. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install boto3
   ```
2. Configure AWS credentials:
   ```bash
   aws configure
   ```
3. Run the script:
   ```bash
   python aws_pentest_script.py
   ```

## How It Works
- Lists all S3 buckets in an AWS account.
- Checks if any buckets are **publicly accessible**, flagging potential security risks.

## Example Output
```
S3 Buckets:
- secure-bucket
- public-bucket

Checking for public S3 buckets:
[ALERT] Publicly accessible bucket found: public-bucket
```

## Future Enhancements
- Expand scanning to **IAM roles and policies**.
- Add **automated remediation** for security risks.
- Implement **Slack/SNS notifications** for real-time alerts.
