# AI Adversarial Attack Defense

## Overview
This project generates adversarial examples to test the robustness of AI models against adversarial attacks. The script introduces small perturbations to an input image to deceive a deep learning model.

## Installation & Setup
1. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install tensorflow numpy pillow
   ```
2. Place a sample image in the project directory (e.g., `sample.jpg`).
3. Run the script:
   ```bash
   python adversarial_attack.py
   ```

## How It Works
- Loads a **pre-trained MobileNetV2 model**.
- Converts an image into a tensor and computes gradients with respect to the model's prediction.
- Applies **small perturbations** to the image to deceive the model.

## Example Output
```
Adversarial example generated successfully.
```

## Future Enhancements
- Implement **multiple adversarial attack techniques**.
- Test against **different deep learning models**.
- Integrate **defense mechanisms** to improve AI robustness.
